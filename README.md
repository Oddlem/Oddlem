My first ever project that I made almost exactly a year ago (as of writing this readme file). It has no frontend and so it only functions in the terminal, you answer 10 questions and it gives you a final "toughness" score at the end. It was made with python and contains two files; the original, and a second that was remade to be more efficient (using the knowledge I had at the time) with OOP-centered architecture.
