I made a mistake during the time I made this account, where I accidentally called my first repository "Oddlem" which... is my username. And that makes this a special repository. So the project in here that you'll be seeing was my first "real" project. I was extremely proud of it at the time! And if you'd like to know more about my thought processes, I believe you can look at the previous version of this Readme file. I don't think I'll keep updating this since it's served it's purpose in that it helped me practice programming, but: Onward to my newer, large scale project!

About me as a person though, I have been learning python since October 2023, and I can safely say it's absolutely turned into a passion of mine. I can ALSO safely say that since then, I've become a competent programmer considering the amount of time I've been learning. There's nowhere to go but up, and I will keep learning programming forever. I am completely certain that I would like to keep doing this for the rest of my life! 

Thank you for reading this far, whoever you might be!
